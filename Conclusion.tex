\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we conduct systematic experiments to analyze the performance implications of various HTTP/2 transport layer candidates on ABR streaming systems, particularly with respect to ABR segment retransmissions. We leverage the multiplexing feature of QUIC and HTTP/2 in order to efficiently implement parallel retransmissions in a higher quality with the objective of maximizing average quality bitrate while also minimizing bitrate variations throughout the duration of a streaming session. We use a nearly isolated testbed setup in CloudLab and measurements "in the wild" to show that QUIC retransmissions provide a significantly better QoE than TCP in high latency, high loss networks while exhibiting comparable QoE in low latency, low loss networks.
