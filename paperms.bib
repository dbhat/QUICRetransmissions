@article{2014mehani_instrumentation_framework,
    abstract = {Experimental research on future Internet technologies involves observing multiple metrics at various dis-
tributed points of the networks under study. Collecting these measurements is often a tedious, repetitive and error prone
task, be it in a testbed or in an uncontrolled field experiment. The relevant experimental data is usually scattered across
multiple hosts in potentially different formats, and sometimes buried amongst a trove of other measurements, irrelevant
to the current study. Collecting, selecting and formatting the useful measurements is a time-consuming and error-prone
manual operation.

In this paper, we present a conceptual {Software-Defined} Measurement ({SDM}) framework to facilitate this task. It
includes a common representation for any type of experimental data, as well as the elements to process and collect the
measurement samples and their associated metadata. We then present an implementation of this concept, which we built
as a major extension and refactoring of the existing Orbit Measurement Library ({OML}). We outline its {API}, and how it
can be used to instrument an experiment in only a few lines of code. We also evaluate the current implementation, and
demonstrate that it efficiently allows measurement collection without interfering with the systems under observation.},

@article{2012mehani_oml_performance,
    abstract = {In all measurement campaigns, one needs to assert that the instrumentation
tools do not significantly impact the system being monitored. This is critical
to future claims based on the collected data and is sometimes overseen in
experimental studies. We propose a method to evaluate the potential "observer
effect" of an instrumentation system, and apply it to the OMF Measurement
Library (OML). OML allows the instrumentation of almost any software to collect
any type of measurements. As it is increasingly being used in networking
research, it is important to characterise possible biases it may introduce in
the collected metrics. Thus, we study its effect on multiple types of reports
from various applications commonly used in wireless research. To this end, we
designed experiments comparing OML-instrumented software with their original
flavours. Our analyses of the results from these experiments show that, with an
appropriate reporting setup, OML has no significant impact on the instrumented
applications, and may even improve some of their performances in specifics
cases. We discuss our methodology and the implication of using OML, and provide
guidelines on instrumenting off-the-shelf software.},

We solve this problem efficiently by adding a proxy server to the Orbit Measurement Library (OML) to transparently buffer measurements on disconnected nodes, and we give results showing our solution in action. We then add a flexible filtering and feedback mechanism on the server that enables a tailored hierarchy of measurement collection servers throughout the network, live context-based steering of experiment behaviour, and live context-based control of the measurement collection process itself. We finish by comparing our architecture to existing work.},

The success of a multiuser distributed testbed facility depends largely on the ease of use, remote access as well as on the ease of collecting useful measurements from experimental runs. OML provides a flexible and dynamic way in which data is collected and made available for realtime access to the experimenters. Application programmers can use simple interfaces provided to transfer measurements and other performance data to a central repository. This paper focuses on the motivation, requirements, design, implementation and real world usage of OML that is designed to provide a scalable, controllable and easy to use mechanism for experimenters to collect useful results from the experiments conducted on the ORBIT testbed.},
